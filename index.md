## About Me

Hello! I'm Ashwin, a graduate student pursuing an MS in Computer Science degree at Columbia University. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2023. My career goal is to advance my knowledge in software development and machine learning to build applications useful to our society. During my time at UT Dallas, I was a part of the Computing Scholars Honors Program and the Hobson Wildenthal Honors College. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, trying out my hand at new tech stacks, and ocassional competitive programming.
